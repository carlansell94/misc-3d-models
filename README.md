This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous 3D models I've created, which don't warrant their own repositories. They are either STL files, or blender project files.

## Current Models
* box-insert: An insert for a wooden box, containing different sized sections for storage
* christmas-tree-stand: A two piece stand for a common PCB christmas tree. Features a section for a rechargeable battery, Adafruit Lipo Amigo Pro for charging/power, and a power switch. The top piece should be slotted onto the tree before soldering it to the PCB base, and the battery pack and original switch should be excluded
* desk-bracket: A couple of brackets to add a back panel to an open-back desk
* ethernet-switch-cover: A cover for a Tenda 8 port ethernet switch, to block out the LEDs
* shuttle-base: A base for the Phyx space shuttle PCB model, which should also be compatible with their other similar model. Friction fit, it hides the coin cell battery while still exposing the power switch
* ikea-akerbar-pot: A trough-like pot that fits neatly inside an Ikea Åkerbär mini greenhouse. Print two ends and the centre piece, slot and glue them together, and add a liner and you're good to go
* bird-feeder-fitting: A fitting to hold a bird feeder pole in a parasol base without wobbling
* usb-pd-board: A small box to house a common USB type C power delivery board. Contains a space to route the wires out of the housing
* led-pwm-controller-board: A small box to house an LED PWM controller board. Note that this design does not provide access for the mode setting button
* large-shelf-divider: A divider to create a 3x3 grid inside a floating cube shelf. This fits the largest cube found in 3-packs of cube floating shelves. Friction fit, no glue required
* wyse-3040-vesa-mount: A Vesa-compatible (100x100) mounting bracket to hold a Dell Wyse 3040. Designed to be secured with two screws, this design has clearance around the screws to fit monitors with a lip around the screw holes. It also has space between the bracket and monitor to allow the mount to be used with monitors that have a curved back. Both closed and open versions are available
* coaster-base: A circular base to sit in a cheese plate/pondue pot, to allow its use as a coaster
